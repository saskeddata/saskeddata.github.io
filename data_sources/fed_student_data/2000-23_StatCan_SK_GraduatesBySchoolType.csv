Footnotes:
1,"All counts are randomly rounded to a multiple of 3 using the following procedure: counts that are already a multiple of 3 are not adjusted; counts 1 greater than a multiple of 3 are adjusted to the next lowest multiple of 3 with a probability of two-thirds and to the next highest multiple of 3 with a probability of one-third. The probabilities are reversed for counts that are 1 less than a multiple of 3."
2,"Totals may not add up to the sum of all categories due to rounding."
3,"The data are subject to revision."
4,"Graduates represent first-time secondary school graduates only."
8,"Public elementary and secondary schools are publicly funded schools that are operated by school boards or the province/territory."
9,"Private/independent elementary and secondary schools are operated, managed and administered by private individuals and/or groups. The extent to which an institution receives its funding from public or private sources does not determine its classification as a public or private/independent school."
5,""Regular programs for youth" are general training programs geared toward and offered primarily to similarly aged young people. Although the majority of enrolments in this category will likely be for school-aged children and youth, some adults may be enrolled."
6,""General programs for adults" are general programs geared toward and offered primarily to adults within the elementary-secondary system. Some youths may be enrolled in order to follow programs of study labelled as "adult education"."
